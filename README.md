# RISC-V LED Simulation using Ripes

This is a simple RISC-V assembly project that demonstrates how low-level instructions can control hardware-like peripherals — in this case, LEDs.

## Tools Used
- [Ripes](ripes.me) – a visual RISC-V processor simulator

## What It Does
- Blinks LEDs in a sequence using basic RISC-V assembly
- Demonstrates register updates, memory operations, and LED output in real-time

## How to Run
1. Download or clone this repo
2. Open `led.s` in Ripes
3. Observe the Processor View, LED Board, and Memory in action

## Demo
- [Demo](https://github.com/K-A8168/riscv-led-simulation-ripes/blame/3b5608e40970f0c5291d7673037a2e236c24a739/ripes%20simulation.mp4)

## Why This Project?
This small simulation connects RISC-V theory with real hardware behavior. It’s a step toward embedded development and architectural exploration.
